1. You can build standalone Arduino library for use in your projects without
   need to use Arduino IDE and Arduino language.

   AVR GCC and avr-binutils must be installed and accessible through PATH.

2. Before using you have to build the library for specific arduino platform.
   Set ARCH variable to the specific platform for which you are going to build the
   library. The currently supported platform are mega and nano. So if you want to
   build Arduino library for Arduino Nano you have to use: 

   make ARCH=nano

   The built library is put in lib/$(ARCH)/libarduino.a.

3. Makefile template for building Arduino applications with the library is in
   misc/Makefile-template, which you may copy to your project source tree and
   modify according to your project specific.
